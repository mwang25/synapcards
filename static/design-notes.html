          <h3>Sections</h3>
          <p>
            Pinned cards which are
            for the author for his own personal favorite cards.
            <br>
            Optional featured cards (done 11/25/17)
            <br>
            Latest cards added (done 11/25/17)
          </p>
          <h3>Cards</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Top row of all cards should have card id on the left, and icons
              in the middle, and a drop down menu on the right.  Card is is a
              hyperlink to the card itself.
            </li>
            <li>
              Heart icon for likes.  Mouse over like icon to see how many likes.
              Should author of the card be allowed to like his own card?  And
              should the icon look different if the author has liked it?
            </li>
            <li>
              Eye icon for number of views.  Too fine grained?
            </li>
            <li>
              If this card is not owned by the viewer, then a bell icon (or
              telescope) for getting notified of updates to this card.  Too
              fine grained?  Is following the user good enough?
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Cards can be private, public, or shared, meaning view permissions
            granted to specific users.  Should we ever allow other people to write to
            someone else's card?  Seems hard to deal with.  They could just
            create a shared account.
          </p>
          <h3>Card Drop down menu</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              If this card is owned by the viewer, then sharing option.
              Sharing allows the owner to make the card private, share with
              other synapcard users, or make the card public.  Instead of putting
              this in the drop down menu, configure it within the context of the
              current add/delete/edit buttons and form?
            </li>
            <li>
              If this card is not owned by the viwer, then copy option.
              Copy will create a new card owned by the current viewer.  Once
              the copy is made, the copy is independent of the original and
              can diverge from the original card.
            </li>
            <li>
              Everyone will have a meta info option, which shows meta info about
              the card, such as creation date, last update date, etc.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Login</h3>
          <p>
            Support for users logging into their own accounts using
            oath/google identification.  Login information is needed to
            implement secure email updates, sharing, and support for multiple
            users.  (done 11/25/17)
          </p>
          <p>
            Each user can optionally create a profile page for him/herself.
            Profile page can also show stats about the account, e.g. how many
            cards the user has created, how
            many added last month, distribution of tags,
            total views(?), total likes(?),
            when the user joined synapcards, etc.  Need at least one setting:
            timezone the user lives in.  (Most of the information is there on
            the user's profile/settings page.  Add more stuff, e.g. tags
            distribution as time goes on.  11/25/17)
          </p>
          <h3>Privacy</h3>
          <p>
            Every card will have privacy control.  They can be
            set to private, shared with specific synapcard users, or public.
          </p>
          <h3>Releases</h3>
          <p><b>0.4 (12/22/17)</b>: Add support for search.</p>
          <p><b>0.3.1 (11/26/17)</b>: Add support for adding, editing, and
            deleting cards.</p>

          <p><b>0.2 (9/17/17)</b>: Dynamic site.  DNS transfered
            Google.  Bought SSL cert from SSLMate, so my site can be accessed
            via https.  Site served by Google AppEngine running python
            webapp2 and Jinja templates. Cards stored and served from
            DataStore, a noSQL database.  Simple user profile page.  Very
            hacky featured cards page with ability to see previous featured
            cards.</p>
          <p><b>0.1 (7/21/17)</b>: static site.  DNS handled by GoDaddy,
            but redirected to Google storage buckets.  Static pages in the
            storage buckets.  Made a logo.  Google analytics tag in all pages.
            Google ad tag in all pages, but Google rejected my site because it
            was not finished yet.</p>
