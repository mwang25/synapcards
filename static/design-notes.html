          <h3>Sections</h3>
          <p>
            Pinned cards which are for the author for his own personal favorite
            cards.  Is this needed?  Can it be done with a tag called "pinned"?
            <br>
            Optional featured cards (done 11/25/17)
            <br>
            Latest cards added (done 11/25/17)
          </p>
          <h3>Cards</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Top row of all cards should have card id on the left, and icons
              in the middle, and a drop down menu on the right.  Card is is a
              hyperlink to the card itself.
            </li>
            <li>
              Heart icon for likes.  Mouse over like icon to see how many likes.
              Should author of the card be allowed to like his own card?  And
              should the icon look different if the author has liked it?
            </li>
            <li>
              Eye icon for number of views.  Too fine grained?
            </li>
            <li>
              If this card is not owned by the viewer, then a bell icon (or
              telescope) for getting notified of updates to this card.  Too
              fine grained?  Is following the user good enough?
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Cards can be private, public, or shared, meaning view permissions
            granted to specific users.  Should we ever allow other people to write to
            someone else's card?  Seems hard to deal with.  They could just
            create a shared account.
          </p>
          <h3>Card Drop down menu</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              If this card is owned by the viewer, then sharing option.
              Sharing allows the owner to make the card private, share with
              other synapcard users, or make the card public.  Instead of putting
              this in the drop down menu, configure it within the context of the
              current add/delete/edit buttons and form?
            </li>
            <li>
              If this card is not owned by the viwer, then copy option.
              Copy will create a new card owned by the current viewer.  Once
              the copy is made, the copy is independent of the original and
              can diverge from the original card.
            </li>
            <li>
              Everyone will have a meta info option, which shows meta info about
              the card, such as creation date, last update date, etc.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Login</h3>
          <p>
            Support for users logging into their own accounts using
            oath/google identification.  Login information is needed to
            implement secure email updates, sharing, and support for multiple
            users.  (done 11/25/17)
          </p>
          <p>
            Each user can optionally create a profile page for him/herself.
            Profile page can also show stats about the account, e.g. how many
            cards the user has created, how
            many added last month, distribution of tags,
            total views(?), total likes(?),
            when the user joined synapcards, etc.  Need at least one setting:
            timezone the user lives in.  (Most of the information is there on
            the user's profile/settings page.  Add more stuff, e.g. tags
            distribution as time goes on.  11/25/17)
          </p>
          <h3>Privacy</h3>
          <p>
            Every card will have privacy control.  They can be
            set to private, shared with specific synapcard users, or public.
          </p>
          <h3>Tag Normalization</h3>
          <p>
            Users entering slightly different tags for the same thing can make
            it hard to find things, e.g. inspiration versus inspirational.
            Need some kind of service to suggest to users to use whichever tag
            is more commonly used.  And also maybe change the other ones (but
            ask the user for permission to change.)
          </p>
          <h3>Search</h3>
          <p>
            Current search page works for exact matches.  A more flexible search
            and search for partial matches, case insensitive matches, and matches
            in multiple fields (e.g. title, summary, and description).  This can
            be a separate standalone service, which will be interesting
            technical work.
