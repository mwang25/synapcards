          <h2>Design Notes</h2>
          <h3>Release 1.0</h3>
          <p>
            As of the end of August 2018, I feel like I have implemented
            enough features to have the 1.0 release of synapcards.com.
            The remainder of this document describes useful features that I wanted
            to implement but couldn't, and some features that I thought about but
            ultimately rejected or set aside indefinately.
          </p>
          <h3>Useful features not implemented (future work)</h3>
          <ol>
            <li><b>Google auth redirection</b>: when logging in using Google auth,
              the redirect message uses the synapcards firebase project name instead
              of just synapcards or google.  Facebook auth redirect looks good.
            </li>
            <li><b>tag completion</b>: as user is typing in the tag in new card
              or search, autocomplete to help the user.
            </li>
            <li><b>tag normalization</b>:
              Users entering slightly different tags for the same thing can make
              it hard to find things, e.g. inspiration versus inspirational.
              Need some kind of service to suggest to users to use whichever tag
              is more commonly used.  And also maybe change the other ones (but
              ask the user for permission to change.)  Maybe this will not be
              needed if we have tag completion.
            </li>
            <li><b>stats in graphs</b>: on the user's profile page or some standalone
              page, display some stats in graph form, such as number of cards created
              over time or distribution of tags. This is good practice for showing
              data as graphs on a web page.
            </li>
            <li><b>improve search</b>: current search requires exact match.
              Allow partial word match over any specified field, e.g. title,
              author, summary, detailed notes.  Allow case insensitive matches.
            </li>
            <li><b>REST API</b>: think of some part of website functionality (search?)
              to offload to a REST API (Google apigee), mainly just to learn
              about using API gateways.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Rejected or set-aside features</h3>
          <ol>
            <li><b>Card privacy levels</b>: currently all cards are public,
              meaning everyone can see.  Could also have private (viewable only
              by owner) or shared (viewable by a specific list of users).
              Hard to implement.
            </li>
            <li><b>Clone a card</b>: when a user sees a good card from another
              user, he can make a copy of it and start editing his copy.
              Somehow the two cards can still have some relationship with each other.
              Seems like an interesting idea, but no clear need for it now.
            </li>
            <li><b>Allow others to edit a card</b>: the owner of a card could
              grant write access to another user.  No need for it now.
            </li>
            <li><b>Pinned cards</b>: using likes and get_all_tags seems to be good enough.
              (e.g. tag a card with "pinned").  Don't see a use case where this
              is really helpful.
            </li>
            <li><b>Eye icon to report how many views of a card</b>: Too fine
              grained, and also not clear exactly when to count a card as
              having been viewed.
            </li>
            <li><b>Follow on a per card basis</b>: too fine grained.  Follow
              user.
            </li>
            <li><b>Drop down menu on top right corner of card</b>: used
              buttons instead.
            </li>
          </ol>
