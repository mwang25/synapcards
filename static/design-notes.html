          <h2>Design Notes</h2>
          <h3>Sections</h3>
          <p>
            Optional featured cards, latest cards added, pinned cards which are
            for the author for his own personal favorite cards.
          </p>
          <h3>Cards</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Top row of all cards should have card id on the left, and icons
              in the middle, and a drop down menu on the right.  Card is is a
              hyperlink to the card itself.
            </li>
            <li>
              Heart icon for likes.  Red color is like by
              the author/owner of the card, pink color is like by other people but
              not the author.  Below the icon is the total number of likes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Eye icon for number of views.
            </li>
            <li>
              If this card is not owned by the viewer, then a bell icon (or
              telescope) for getting notified of updates to this card.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Cards can be private, public, or view permissions granted to
            specific users.  Should we ever allow other people to write to
            someone else's card?  Seems hard to deal with.  They could just
            create a shared account.
          </p>
          <h3>Card Drop down menu</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>If this card is owned by the viewer, then edit option.</li>
            <li>
              If this card is owned by the viewer, then sharing option.
              Sharing allows the owner to make the card private, share with
              other synapcard users, or make the card public.
            </li>
            <li>If this card is owned by the viewer, then archive option.</li>
            <li>If this card is owned by the viewer, then delete option.</li>
            <li>
              If this card is not owned by the viwer, then copy option.
              Copy will create a new card owned by the current viewer.  Once
              the copy is made, the copy is independent of the original and
              can diverge from the original card.
            </li>
            <li>
              Everyone will have a meta info option, which shows meta info about
              the card, such as creation date, last update date, etc.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Login</h3>
          <p>
            Support for users logging into their own accounts using
            oath/google identification.  Login information is needed to
            implement secure email updates, sharing, and support for multiple
            users.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each user can optionally create a profile page for him/herself.
            Profile page can also show stats about the account, e.g. how many
            cards the user has created, how
            many added last week, total views, total likes, when the user joined
            synapcards, etc.
          </p>
          <h3>Privacy</h3>
          <p>
            Every card, section, page will have privacy control.  They can be
            set to private, shared with specific synapcard users, or public.
