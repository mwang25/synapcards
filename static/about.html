          <h2>About SynapCards</h2>
          <p>
            SynapCards is a self-directed technical project I am working
            on while taking a break from work.  It has 3 main purposes,
            listed in order of importance:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Allows me to learn and experiment with various web technologies,
              such as html, css, javascript, web backends and infrastrucure,
              (specifically GCP, Google Cloud Platform), etc.
            </li>
            <li>
              I have been searching for a better way for
              me to organize and look up all the information that I come across.
              So I am using two familiar things from the physical world
              (neural synapses and index cards) to create a virtual knowledge
              database.  Typically, an index card holds one chunk of knowledge,
              such as notes from a Ted talk or from an article, perferably with
              a link to the source video or document.  But a card could
              also be a higher level abstraction like "Favorite Inspirational Ted Talks".
              Synapses are less defined.  They connect the index cards via
              the tags, hyperlinks, and maybe other relationships.  I haven't
              fleshed out that concept yet.
            </li>
            <li>
              If this actually turns into a real product and I can
              make some money from it, great!!  If not, that's OK too.  <em>Its
              the journey that is important, not the destination.</em>
            </li>
           </ol>
